    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>This project explores the creation of a Deep Water Culture (DWC) hydroponic system for growing tomatoes indoors. Designed within a modest corner of my bedroom and built under a $500 budget, the goal was to develop a clean, efficient, and sustainable method for cultivating tomatoes in a small space using limited resources.

      The system was built around four individual 5-gallon buckets, each housing a net pot and connected to a centralized air pump for root oxygenation. Above the setup, a suspended full-spectrum LED grow light provides the necessary photosynthetic energy to support healthy vine growth. Every element—from the tubing layout to bucket spacing—was carefully planned to optimize airflow, light distribution, and nutrient uptake, all while fitting within the physical constraints of an indoor room.
      
      Throughout the build, key considerations included plant growth dynamics, energy efficiency, and maintaining consistent environmental conditions such as pH and water temperature. The design was iterated through digital modeling in SketchUp, enabling visualization of space usage and airflow before physically assembling the system.
      
      This project not only showcases the viability of hydroponic systems in non-traditional spaces but also demonstrates how thoughtful design, basic engineering, and resourceful planning can bring sustainable food cultivation into everyday living environments.</p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Grow Area:</strong> Indoor corner (approx. 5 x 2.5x x 4ft)</li>
      <li><strong>Plants:</strong> Vine tomatoes (cherry)</li>
      <li><strong>System Type:</strong> Deep Water Culture (static)</li>
      <li><strong>Lighting:</strong> 18 hours/day LED full-spectrum</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>System Design & Materials</h2>
    <p>Key materials used:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>5-gallon buckets (reservoirs)</li>
      <li>Net pots + hydroton clay pebbles</li>
      <li>Air pump + air stones</li>
      <li>Flexible tubing (food-grade)</li>
      <li>LED grow light + height adjuster</li>
      <li>Nutrient mix + pH/EC meter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project Milestones</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Week 1: Research & Planning</li>
      <li>Week 2: SketchUp Design & Material Sourcing</li>
      <li>Week 3: Assembly & Testing</li>
      <li>Week 4: Monitoring Growth + Adjustments</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>One of the biggest challenges I faced was balancing the vertical growth of tomato vines with consistent light coverage. Since tomatoes naturally climb, I had to be strategic with how high I placed the LED grow light. Too low, and the plants wouldn’t have room to grow upward. Too high, and the lower leaves wouldn’t get enough light. I solved this by suspending the light at a fixed height and training the vines early using soft ties, gently guiding them laterally to keep the canopy even across all buckets. This helped the plants share light more evenly and made better use of the limited vertical space.

      Another challenge was keeping the pH stable in each bucket. In a Deep Water Culture setup, especially with smaller reservoirs, the pH can shift quickly due to nutrient uptake and evaporation. To manage this, I created a simple monitoring routine—checking pH levels every other day using a digital meter and adjusting as needed with pH up/down solutions. I also used a notebook to track fluctuations over time, which helped me understand how my environment and feeding schedule affected water chemistry. Over time, the adjustments became quicker and more intuitive.</p>

      <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Adjustable light pulley system for optimizing canopy light coverage as plants grow</li>
        <li>Mylar-lined walls to boost light reflectivity and reduce energy waste</li>
        <li>pH buffer solution and thermometer to maintain ideal nutrient and temperature range</li>
        <li>Air stones in each bucket to improve dissolved oxygen and prevent root rot</li>
        <li>Hydroton or clay pebbles in net pots for stable root support and aeration</li>
        <li>Digital timer for automating light cycles and reducing human error</li>
        <li>Surge-protected power outlet for safety and continuous airflow operation</li>
      </ul>
      

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>lThis Deep Water Culture (DWC) system proved to be an effective and practical method for growing tomatoes indoors. It required minimal floor space, making it ideal for small-scale environments such as apartments or limited grow rooms. The system was cost-effective, staying well within a $500 budget, while still incorporating essential components like aeration, lighting, and nutrient monitoring.

      Beyond its affordability and compact design, the DWC system offered a valuable hands-on learning experience in hydroponic principles. From managing pH and EC levels to adjusting airflow and lighting, the project provided direct insight into the complexities and benefits of soilless cultivation. The modular nature of the setup also allows for easy scalability or customization depending on future crop demands or spatial constraints.
      
      Overall, the project demonstrated that with careful planning and strategic material choices, DWC can serve as an accessible and rewarding introduction to hydroponic farming — particularly for high-yield crops like tomatoes.</p>
